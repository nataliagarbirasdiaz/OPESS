# Description of the series

OPESS presents speakers working in the area of political economy. Presentations are of papers that use economic methods as well as papers that substantively study the intersection of economics and politics. Presentations are 30-40 minutes, followed by a 5-10 minute discussion from a pre-assigned discussant and a 40 minute general Q\&A session. Following the events, discussants and participants  may join the speaker and organizers for dinner –– unfortunately, this will have to be at their own expense. Participants may also sign up to meet up with speakers outside the event –– for example to show them around on EUI premises. To sign up for the dinner, meet-ups, and campus tours, follow [this link](https://eui1-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/daniel_urquijo_eui_eu/EWEcIUzHjmlGnizW2JvjeoUBbj2ZaA1aiqkYYWnCSredow?e=ftn5OR). 

## When?

OPESS meets occasionally on Thursdays from 5:00-6:30pm, and not more often than every other week. 

## Where? 

Badia Fiesolana, EUI. See below for the exact location for each meeting. The event is in-person and on-line. Registration is required for online attendance. Attendance is generally restricted to members of the EUI community.

  * January 26:  [Nicola Mastrorocco](http://nicolamastrorocco.com/)
     + Title: **State Capacity as an Organizational Problem. Evidence from the growth of the US State over 100 years**. Co-authored with Edoardo Teso (Northwestern University). 
     + Abstract: We study the process of modernization of the State through the lenses of the U.S. federal government, analysing how its bureaucratic structure, selection and promotion policies changes from 1816 to 1905. We digitize archival records containing the roster of all U.S. federal employees over this period, with information on their position in the bureaucratic hierarchy, specific occupation and compensation. The data contains information on the name, place of residence and place of birth of all employees, which allows to track their careers over time and to match them to historical censuses data. Using this unique dataset, we can study the organization of a State over the different stages of its development, and document how its organizational characteristics change during the process of modernization.

     + Title: **The Unequal Spirit of the Protestant Reformation: Particularism and Wealth Distribution in Early Modern Germany**. 
     + Abstract: This paper studies the impact of the Protestant Reformation on wealth distribution and inequality in confessionally divided Germany, between 1400 and 1800. The Reformation expanded social welfare, but provided it in a particularistic way to insiders only. This gave Protestantism an ambiguous character in terms of redistribution and its impact on inequality. I develop a theoretical framework of this trade-off between welfare expansion and particularistic provision, and test its implications empirically, using a Difference-in-Differences and an Instrumental Variable strategy. In line with the theoretical framework, I document that the Reformation exacerbated inequality overall, by making marginal poor people relatively poorer. The result is driven by the introduction of new particularistic poor relief policies in Protestant communities. The inegalitarian character of Protestantism, typically found in contemporary societies, can be traced back to the beginning of the Reformation in the sixteenth century.

  * February 23:  [Daniel Goldstein](https://daniel-a-n-goldstein.com/)
     + Title: **The Weight of Precedent: the Two-Term Tradition and Norm Violations in the United States Presidency**. Co-authored with Collin Schumock (Yale University).
     + Abstract: In the United States, a political norm initiated by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson limited presidents for generations to two terms in office. Despite challenges, the norm lasted 144 years and was only violated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, a popular incumbent during a crisis. We ask when an informal constraint on an executive carries weight and when it falters. Leveraging a dynamic formal model, we uncover how an incumbent executive's electoral prospects among citizens and the role of parties interact to make a ''norm of constraint'' credible. Additionally, we consider an executive's choice to establish a term-limit norm, the endogenous reinforcement of the norm, and when it is `formalized' into codified law.

## Speakers during Fall 2022

  * September 29: [Gary Cox](https://gwcox.sites.stanford.edu/)
      +  Title: **[Nonunitary Parties, Government Formation, and Gamson’s Law](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/nonunitary-parties-government-formation-and-gamsons-law/F1141F85A250739AB75F63E0773B94E5)**
      + Abstract: Following the coalition literature highlighting intraparty politics (e.g., Giannetti and Benoit 2009; Laver 1999; Strøm 2003), I address the well-known “portfolio allocation paradox” (Warwick and Druckman 2006) by introducing a new model of government formation based on two main assumptions. First, no actor has a structural advantage in the negotiations leading to government formation. Second, all actors who can deprive the coalition of a majority (or other critical threshold size) must be included in the negotiations—not just parties. Whereas standard bargaining models are inconsistent with Gamson’s Law, the model proposed here implies that equilibrium portfolio allocations should be mostly Gamsonian but with a small-party bias, as the empirical literature has long found. Empirically, I show that my model outperforms the literature’s standard specification (due to Browne and Franklin 1973). Moreover, one of the model’s new predictions—that candidate-centered electoral rules should promote more Gamsonian portfolio allocations—is supported.

 * October 27:  [Manoel Gehrke](https://manoelgehrke.com/)
      + Title: **Convictions for Corruption and Government Approval: Global Evidence**. Co-authored with Feng Yang (Peking University).
      + Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether incumbent governments benefit politically from the punishment of corruption. Using an original data set on convictions from across the world and nationally representative surveys for 160 countries from 2006 to 2019, we show that convicting former heads of government for corruption reduces citizens' perceptions of corruption and boosts government support. We demonstrate that these effects last for approximately two years and are attenuated by a decision by the executive to pardon the conviction. These results inform debates on the political implications of anti-corruption, showing that convictions help to strengthen governments' hold on power.

      + Title: **Corruption and the Rise of Political Outsiders: Evidence from Audits and Elections in Brazil**
      + Abstract: In this paper, I assess how changes in voter awareness of valence issues may influence not only voters but also candidate strategies. While revelations about corruption have been shown to influence citizens' votes, less is known about how outsiders take advantage of the increased opportunity to enter the electoral race. I construct a new measure of candidates' use of anti-corruption rhetoric using the manifestos registered by more than fifty thousand mayoral candidates in Brazil who ran for election between 2012 and 2020. I show that outsider candidates are, in general, more likely to resort to anti-corruption appeals. I then exploit the revelation of corruption in Brazilian mayoral accounts, using random annual audits conducted by the federal government to test whether outsider candidates are more likely to take advantage of changes in the salience of corruption. The results indicate that municipalities exposed to this valence shock experienced greater entry of outsider candidates. This paper points to how changes in corruption salience can help overcome barriers to entry for outside candidates; in doing so, it calls for future research on the potential effects on risks of democratic backsliding.
