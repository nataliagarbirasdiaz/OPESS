The series is organized by [Miriam Golden](https://www.miriamgolden.com/) and [Natalia Garbiras-Díaz](https://www.nataliagarbirasdiaz.com/), along with [Daniel Urquijo](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=daniel-urquijo).

# Description of the series

OPESS presents speakers working in the area of political economy. Presentations are of papers that use economic methods as well as papers that substantively study the intersection of economics and politics. Presentations are 30-40 minutes, followed by a 5-10 minute discussion from a pre-assigned discussant and a 40 minute general Q\&A session. Following the events, discussants and participants  may join the speaker and organizers for dinner –– unfortunately, this will have to be at their own expense. Participants may also sign up to meet up with speakers outside the event –– for example to show them around on EUI premises. To sign up for the dinner, meet-ups, and campus tours, follow [this link](https://eui1-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/natalia_garbirasdiaz_eui_eu/EdTM2ENF5RZCjP8iUTXa3s8B-vIV61Qn6SN0YXQVsLedeQ?e=hEcIv5). 

## When?

## Speakers during Fall 2022

  * September 29: [Gary Cox](https://gwcox.sites.stanford.edu/)
      +  Title: **[Nonunitary Parties, Government Formation, and Gamson’s Law](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/nonunitary-parties-government-formation-and-gamsons-law/F1141F85A250739AB75F63E0773B94E5)**
      + Abstract: Following the coalition literature highlighting intraparty politics (e.g., Giannetti and Benoit 2009; Laver 1999; Strøm 2003), I address the well-known “portfolio allocation paradox” (Warwick and Druckman 2006) by introducing a new model of government formation based on two main assumptions. First, no actor has a structural advantage in the negotiations leading to government formation. Second, all actors who can deprive the coalition of a majority (or other critical threshold size) must be included in the negotiations—not just parties. Whereas standard bargaining models are inconsistent with Gamson’s Law, the model proposed here implies that equilibrium portfolio allocations should be mostly Gamsonian but with a small-party bias, as the empirical literature has long found. Empirically, I show that my model outperforms the literature’s standard specification (due to Browne and Franklin 1973). Moreover, one of the model’s new predictions—that candidate-centered electoral rules should promote more Gamsonian portfolio allocations—is supported. 
      + Location: Seminar Room 2 
      + Discussant: Daniel Goldstein
 * October 27:  [Manoel Gehrke](https://manoelgehrke.com/)
      + Title: **Convictions for Corruption and Government Approval: Global Evidence**. Co-authored with Feng Yang (Peking University).
      + Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether incumbent governments benefit politically from the punishment of corruption. Using an original data set on convictions from across the world and nationally representative surveys for 160 countries from 2006 to 2019, we show that convicting former heads of government for corruption reduces citizens' perceptions of corruption and boosts government support. We demonstrate that these effects last for approximately two years and are attenuated by a decision by the executive to pardon the conviction. These results inform debates on the political implications of anti-corruption, showing that convictions help to strengthen governments' hold on power.
      + Location: Emeroteca
      + Discussant: Anna Clemente
  * November 10: [Natalia Garbiras-Diaz](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=natalia-garbiras-diaz)
      + Title: **Corruption and the Rise of Political Outsiders: Evidence from Audits and Elections in Brazil**
      + Abstract: In this paper, I assess how changes in voter awareness of valence issues may influence not only voters but also candidate strategies. While revelations about corruption have been shown to influence citizens' votes, less is known about how outsiders take advantage of the increased opportunity to enter the electoral race. I construct a new measure of candidates' use of anti-corruption rhetoric using the manifestos registered by more than fifty thousand mayoral candidates in Brazil who ran for election between 2012 and 2020. I show that outsider candidates are, in general, more likely to resort to anti-corruption appeals. I then exploit the revelation of corruption in Brazilian mayoral accounts, using random annual audits conducted by the federal government to test whether outsider candidates are more likely to take advantage of changes in the salience of corruption. The results indicate that municipalities exposed to this valence shock experienced greater entry of outsider candidates. This paper points to how changes in corruption salience can help overcome barriers to entry for outside candidates; in doing so, it calls for future research on the potential effects on risks of democratic backsliding.
